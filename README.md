Cloudino is a Full Stack Internet of Things Platform, Open Source and Open Hardware, that allows the development and instrumentation of Internet of the Things Solutions in a Simple and Transparent way.
Â 
<br>The Cloudino Platform was designed thinking in 4 main characteristics: small size, easy to use, low cost hardware and modularity. And with these characteristics, that the Cloudino platform allows to everyone the possibility to incorporate IoT technologies in their projects without any technical or economical limitations.


![Cloudino Characteristics](https://github.com/Cloudino/Cloudino-Doc/raw/master/Cloudino_characteristics.png)

Cloudino is developed and maintained by INFOTEC (Public Research Center of CONACYT) as a Open Source and Open Hardware Platform

## Cloudino Architecture

The Cloudino Platform proposes to add a new IoT Chip (Cloudino WiFi Connector) that works like a configurable Network Layer between the sensors, actuators or existent hardware solutions like Arduino and the Cloud Services, for a simple and fast start to IoT World.

## Cloudino WiFi Connector

![Cloudino CC](https://github.com/Cloudino/Cloudino-Doc/raw/master/Cloudino.png)

The **Cloudino WiFi Connector**, which is a little, inexpensive and powerful IoT Chip, that **has preprogrammed** the most common IoT protocols like a **MQTT** or the **NGSI** for the Orion Context Broker, that allows everyone to start sending information to the Cloud without any additional programming effort.

We can see the **Cloudino WiFi Connector** as an **IoT Router**, where let us configure using a simple web browser, the internet settings as well as the IoT protocol that the chip will use.

An other important characteristic of the **Cloudino WiFi Connector** is that can **working in parallel with the Arduino**, the WCC can be used as an **Cloudino WiFi Connector**, I mean, we can reprogram the Arduino via Cloud.

The **Cloudino WiFi Connector** working with Arduino is not like an Arduino shield, is an other processor working in parallel dedicated only to the network layer including the IoT protocols, leaving the Arduino dedicated to the connectivity with the sensors and actuators, while allowing reprogramming Arduino via WiFi or Cloud.

The **Cloudino WiFi Connector** can be used as we mention as an **additional microcontroller dedicated to the network layer, working in parallel with actual microcontroller solutions like arduino**. But also can be used as a **stand alone device** for directly communicate the real-life objects to the internet.

## Cloudino Stand Along

## Cloudino with Arduino

**Cloudino** can be work in **parallel with Arduino** using it like an **Arduino Cloud Programmer**.

For this you only need to use tree ping from the Arduino (TX, TX , RST) and the additional (5V, GND)
