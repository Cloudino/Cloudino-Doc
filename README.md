Cloudino is a Full Stack Internet of Things Platform, Open Source and Open Hardware, that allows the development and instrumentation of Internet of the Things Solutions in a Simple and Transparent way.
Â 
<br>The Cloudino Platform was designed thinking in 4 main characteristics: small size, easy to use, low cost hardware and modularity. And with these characteristics, that the Cloudino platform allows to everyone the possibility to incorporate IoT technologies in their projects without any technical or economical limitations.

Cloudino is developed and maintained by INFOTEC (Public Research Center of CONACYT) as a Open Source and Open Hardware Platform

## Cloudino Architecture

The Cloudino Platform proposes to add a new IoT Chip (Cloudino WiFi Connector) that works like a configurable Network Layer between the sensors, actuators or existent hardware solutions like Arduino and the Cloud Services, for a simple and fast start to IoT World.

## Cloudino Wifi Connector
The main component is the "WiFi Cloud Connector" which allows you to connect any Arduino to the Internet in simple way.

The WiFi Cloud Connector is not an Arduino shield, is an other processor working in parallel dedicated only to the network layer including the IoT protocols, leaving the Arduino dedicated to the connectivity with the sensors and actuators, while allowing reprogramming Arduino via WiFi or Cloud.
