Welcome to Cloudino Documentation!
===================
Cloudino is an Internet of Things Platform that allows you to connect to the cloud, differents MCU platforms (Atmel AVR, Microchip PIC, etc.) in a very easy and transparent way.

Cloudino is developed and maintained by INFOTEC (Public Research Center of CONACYT) as a Open Source and Open Hardware Platform

The WiFi Cloud Connector is not an Arduino shield, is an other processor working in parallel dedicated only to the network layer including the IoT protocols, leaving the Arduino dedicated to the connectivity with the sensors and actuators, while allowing reprogramming Arduino via WiFi or Cloud.
